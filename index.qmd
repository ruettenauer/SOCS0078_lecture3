This module introduces students to the politics, sociology, and economics of the environment and climate change. Topics covered include the changing public opinion on climate change, the social bases of pro-environment behavior, the prisoner dilemma and tragedy of the commons, and the challenge of designing effective policy responses at the national and international level. Moreover, we investigate the role of public opinion and social movements in shaping environmental policy. Finally, we consider the unequal economic and social impact of climate change, including distributional aspects and consequences of extreme weather events.
